Algebra of Programming in Agda: Dependent Types for Relational Program Derivation

Dependent type theory is rich enough to express that a program satisfies an input/output relational specification, but it could be hard to construct the proof term. On the other hand, squiggolists know very well how to show that one relation is included in another by algebraic reasoning. The AoPA library allows one to encode Algebra of Programming style program derivation, both functional and relational, in Agda.
